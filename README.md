# **Computer Vision Dashboard**

## **Introduction**

* **Project Overview:** A platform showcasing powerful computer vision applications, from text recognition to 3D object detection.  
* **Key Strengths:**  
  * **High Accuracy:** Our models deliver precise results.  
  * **Always On:** The dashboard is available 24/7.  
  * **Fast Processing:** We get you results quickly.  
  * **Auto-Generation:** It can even turn designs into code automatically.

## **Technical Architecture**

* **Backend: Django**  
  * **What it does:** The brain of the application. It handles all the complex data processing and manages the different AI models.  
  * **How we built it:** We used Django templates to easily create each page you see. This kept our code organized and made it simple to add new features.  
  * **A smart choice:** Storing uploaded files in a dedicated media/uploads directory gave us a simple and secure way to manage user data.  
* **Frontend: HTML \+ Vanilla JavaScript**  
  * **What it does:** The user interface you interact with. It's built with HTML for structure and JavaScript to make everything interactive.

## **Featured Models**

### **1\. OCR Model (Text Extraction)**

* **Function:** Extracts text from any image, even handwritten notes.  
* **Why it matters:** It's perfect for digitizing documents, receipts, or any text you can photograph.  
* **Demonstration:** Show a real-time example of a document being processed.

### **2\. 2D Model (Image Recognition)**

* **Function:** Identifies objects and scenes in images.  
* **Why it matters:** It can recognize everything from cars in a photo to a specific object in a room.  
* **Demonstration:** Show a clear example of objects being identified on screen.

### **3\. 3D Model (3D Object Detection)**

* **Function:** Detects and reconstructs objects in 3D space.  
* **Why it matters:** This technology is critical for robotics, augmented reality, and other next-generation applications.  
* **Demonstration:** Showcase a simple 3D object detection example.

### **4\. Interest Points (Feature Detection)**

* **Function:** Finds and analyzes unique features within an image, like corners and edges.  
* **Why it matters:** It's the technology behind things like facial recognition and image tracking.  
* **Demonstration:** Highlight the detected points on a sample image.

### **5\. GUI2Code (Design to Code Conversion)**

* **Function:** Transforms a design image into functional code.  
* **Why it matters:** It streamlines development, saving time and effort.  
* **Demonstration:** Upload a simple design and show the generated code.

## **Conclusion**

* **Summary:** The Computer Vision Dashboard is a powerful, integrated platform that demonstrates the practical applications of modern AI.  
* **Future Plans:** We plan to add more models and improve the user experience based on feedback.  
* **Thank You:** Thank you for your time. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have.
